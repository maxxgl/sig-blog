At the beginning of the chapter, we are reminded by Paul that we are free. Christ came to free us from the law. So therefore we shall not walk in that yoke of slavery anymore. This is such an encouragement to remember as we are looking at all the religions in the world and what people follow after. The difference between religion and a relationship with the Lord is so important to understand as you grow in Christ. We are not under the law anymore. We do not make sacrifices or have to do any certain performance for the Lord. We are free from the law. Saved by grace through faith. Run away from the churches that try to tell you you HAVE to take and eat of this bread to be saved, you HAVE to confess to the priest, you HAVE to be baptized as a baby. These are not sounding like very free things to me. It is about the heart, not the work. When your love is for Christ that is where you will find true freedom. We are reminded also by Paul that Christ would be of no value to us if we lived by the Law. He came to fulfill the law. We get to walk in Jesusâ€™s grace. Again it is faith working through love. (Galatians 5:6) Now that we are called to freedom we are not to live in the flesh but walk in step with the spirit. 

## Galatians 5:16-18
We are at war between the desires of the flesh and the Spirit. The two oppose each other. We Christians are on the battlefield daily. Our souls are at war inside. Praise Jesus the battle has already been won but we are being sanctified through the work of the Spirit. As we walk in the spirit we will not gratify the desires of the flesh. If the spirit leads us we are not under the law. 

## Galatians 19-26 
These beginning verses explain the evils of walking in the flesh and these things will not inherit the kingdom of heaven  We are to stay far away from these things. But May we walk in the Spirit bearing the fruits of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; Those who are in Christ crucified these desires of the flesh. May we pray daily to walk by the Spirit bearing fruit in all its goodness. Remember to not grow conceited or envying one another but to love our neighbors as ourselves and look to the Spirit to be transformed. 

Dear Heavenly Father, You are gracious in our lives and so very faithful. Thank you for your son Jesus and what He has done for us, we are no longer slaves to the law but we are called to freedom in Him. Help us walk in the Spirit and not gratify the desires of the flesh. May your Holy Spirit transform our hearts and minds to produce fruits that prove to be an example of who you are so we can share your goodness and point people to you. We love you with all our heart, soul, and mind.

In Jesus' name Amen.
